# auto-password-hacker
This is a Python program that attempts to hack a 4-digit password using an auto-input function. The program includes a GUI with an input field, start button, and show/hide password button. The program also keeps track of incorrect password attempts and automatically inputs the next possible password until the correct password is found.
